// count : number of remaining cards in the deck, should be readonly.

// methods:
// shuffle() : rearranges cards in the deck randomly.
// draw(n) : removes the last n cards from the deck and returns them.

// Implementation Details: Initially each deck is filled with 52 cards (13 from each of 4 suits).

// Card Class Description:
// Class members:

// properties:
// suit : the suit of the card (i.e. ['Hearts', 'Diamonds', 'Clubs', â€˜Spades']).
// rank: an integer from 1 to 13. ("Ace" is 1, "King" is 13, i.e. {1: 'Ace', 11: 'Jack', 12: 'Queen', 13: 'King'}).
// isFaceCard : a readonly property that defines whether a card is a face card (i.e. rank is either 1 or > 10).

// methods:
// toString(): human-readable string representation of the card (e.g. "Ace of Spades", "10 of Clubs", "Queen of Hearts" etc.)
// Compare(cardOne, cardTwo): Cards must be Comparable to other cards by ranks only (no special handling for Ace).

// Player Class Description
// Class members:

// properties:

// name : player name;
// wins: number of wins, readonly;
// deck : a deck of cards;

// methods:
// Play(playerOne, playerTwo): starts the game;

// Implementation Details:

// Players both take a card from their deck.
// Whoever has a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point).
// After the two cards are discarded (removed from the deck), they flip the next card from the deck.
// The game lasts until they are run out of cards.
// When game ends, figure out who is a winner (compare their scores) and return a summing up message with the final score: {Winner} wins {X} to {Y} (i.e. "John wins 10 to 7").

// Please think carefully, what should be exposed to the world and what should be kept private (encapsulate sensitive data and unnecessary implementation
// details). Consider making use of static methods!
