// methods:

// Class members:

// properties:

// Implementation Details:

// Players both take a card from their deck.
// Whoever has a card with higher value wins the round and gets one point (if the cards are of the same value, neither of them gets a point).
// After the two cards are discarded (removed from the deck), they flip the next card from the deck.
// The game lasts until they are run out of cards.
// When game ends, figure out who is a winner (compare their scores) and return a summing up message with the final score: {Winner} wins {X} to {Y} (i.e. "John wins 10 to 7").
